# Foundations
## Data processing

This repository contains the slides, scripts, and data required for the
"Data processing" NZILBB R, Stats, and Open Science workshop.

The easiest way to interact with this material is to run the following command
in your R console:

```{r}
usethis::create_from_github(
  "https://github.com/nzilbb/ws-data-processing
)
```

This assumes you have completed the steps in the [induction section at the
NZILBB R, Stats, and Open Science workshops website](https://nzilbb.github.io/statistics_workshops/#sec-induction)

The command above will make your own copy of this repository on GitHub (a
'fork'), download it to your compute ('clone' it), and open a new RStudio 
project.
